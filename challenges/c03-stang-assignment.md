*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, mu_00, E_45, mu_45, E_90, mu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 mu_00  E_45  mu_45  E_90 mu_90 alloy  
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  
    ## 1 0.022 10600 0.321 10700  0.329 10500 0.31  al_24st
    ## 2 0.022 10600 0.323 10500  0.331 10700 0.323 al_24st
    ## 3 0.032 10400 0.329 10400  0.318 10300 0.322 al_24st
    ## 4 0.032 10300 0.319 10500  0.326 10400 0.33  al_24st
    ## 5 0.064 10500 0.323 10400  0.331 10400 0.327 al_24st
    ## 6 0.064 10700 0.328 10500  0.328 10500 0.32  al_24st
    ## 7 0.081 10000 0.315 10000  0.32   9900 0.314 al_24st

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, mu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("E") | starts_with("mu"),
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    names_transform = list(angle = as.integer)
  ) %>% 
  filter(E > 0 & mu > 0)
df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    mu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # … with 16 more rows

Use the following tests to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
              setequal(
                df_stang_long %>% names,
                c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "mu")
              )
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
df_stang_long %>% 
  group_by(thick) %>% 
  reframe(range_E = range(E), range_mu = range(mu))
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 × 3
    ##   thick range_E range_mu
    ##   <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1 0.022   10500    0.31 
    ## 2 0.022   10700    0.331
    ## 3 0.032   10300    0.318
    ## 4 0.032   10500    0.33 
    ## 5 0.064   10400    0.32 
    ## 6 0.064   10700    0.331
    ## 7 0.081    9900    0.311
    ## 8 0.081   10100    0.32

``` r
df_stang_long %>% distinct(alloy)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   alloy  
    ##   <chr>  
    ## 1 al_24st

``` r
df_stang_long %>% distinct(angle)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 1
    ##   angle
    ##   <int>
    ## 1     0
    ## 2    45
    ## 3    90

``` r
df_stang_long %>% distinct(thick)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 1
    ##   thick
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1 0.022
    ## 2 0.032
    ## 3 0.064
    ## 4 0.081

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No, even for a given thickness of an alloy at a specific angle, the
    `E` and `mu` had variations among observations.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - There is only one alloy in the dataset. There is only `al_24st` as a
    distinct value.
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, 90 degrees were tested.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081 were tested.
- What’s the relationship between the thickness, E, and mu?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
plot_E <-
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = df_stang_long,
    mapping = aes(x = thick, y = E)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_stang_long %>% 
      group_by(thick, angle) %>% 
      summarize(mean_E = mean(E)),
    mapping = aes(x = thick, y = mean_E, color = "Average E"),
  ) +
  facet_grid(angle ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Average E" = '#149D3C')) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
plot_mu <-
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = df_stang_long,
    mapping = aes(x = thick, y = mu)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_stang_long %>% 
      group_by(thick, angle) %>% 
      summarize(mean_mu = mean(mu)),
    mapping = aes(x = thick, y = mean_mu, color = "Average mu"),
  ) +
  facet_grid(angle ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Average mu" = 'blue')) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
ggarrange(plot_E, plot_mu, ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- It’s tempting to say that `E` and `mu` decreases as thickness
  increases. However, the relationship from the plot seems monotone and
  varying according to the angle and the thickness.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - The graph above shows some degree of variance in E, especially when
    the thickness is 0.081 versus any other. But I’m uncertain whether
    the degree of decrease in E is sufficient to claim that the
    elasticity is not an intensive property of the material since I
    don’t know the how significant of a difference this is relative to
    other alloys.
