*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

``` r
head(df_titanic)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 5
    ##   Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##   <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ## 1 1st   Male   Child No           0
    ## 2 2nd   Male   Child No           0
    ## 3 3rd   Male   Child No          35
    ## 4 Crew  Male   Child No           0
    ## 5 1st   Female Child No           0
    ## 6 2nd   Female Child No           0

**Observations**:

- Class, Sex, Age, Survived, n

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - The Wikipedia claims that there were about 2224 passengers and crew
    whereas the total in the dataset were 2201, which accounts for about
    99% of the people aboard.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - On the Wikipedia page, it notes that the exact number on the ship
    were unclear because of the confusions on the passenger list (like
    last minute cancellations that weren’t account for) and people who
    were travelling with different identities that led to duplicate
    data. Thus, the dataset from the R package might have used a
    different set of metrics to decide the people on the ship from the
    dataset on the Wikipedia page.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Most survivors were females among the 1st and 2nd class passengers and
  about the same for as male for 3rd class.
- In order of Crew, 1st, 3rd, and 2nd had the most number of survivors.
- Crew had male surviors as the vast majority.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The survival rates for female and male passengers look much more
  balanced than the previous plot.
- Crew actually had much more females survive in proportional to the
  total.
- Because the Prop totals to a value not equal to 1, it’s hard to tell
  what the data is actually trying to represent.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - The y-axis which represents Prop should in theory total to 1 for all
    the bars but none of them do.
  - There are NaN values in the Prop column for some rows where the
    proportions do not exist (n was divided by a total of 0).

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(Age ~ Sex)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- All children survived in the 1st and 2nd class, but less than majority
  in the 3rd class.
- Much more females survived proportionally to the males across all
  classes.
- Generally, more 1st and 2nd passengers survived but not among male
  adults where the number of 3rd class survivors surpassed that of 2nd
  class.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - Since the proportions were calculated among groups based on Class,
    Sex, and Age, combining proportions from any of those variables
    resulted in a Prop value that was greater than what was expected.
  - By faceting the plot into Age and Sex, the bars showed Prop value
    less than or equal to 1, which was logical.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
