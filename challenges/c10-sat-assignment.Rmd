## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight** before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

*Background*: Every year about 2 million students take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The exam is [controversial](http://www.nea.org/home/73288.htm) but [extremely consequential](https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0518/p13s01-legn.html). There are many claims about the SAT, but we're going to look at just one: Is the SAT predictive of scholastic performance in college? It turns out this is a fairly complicated question to assess---we'll get an introduction to some of the complexities.

# Obtain the Data
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### __q1__ Visit the [SAT and College GPA](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/case_studies/sat.html) case study page, scroll to the bottom, and click the `Open Data with Excel` button. This will allow you to download an `xls` file. Save the file to your `data` folder, load the data as `df_sat`, and perform your "first checks" against these data. Answer the questions below:

```{r q1-task}
## TODO:
df_sat <- read_xls("data/sat.xls")

## TODO: Do your "first checks"
df_sat %>% 
  summary()
```

**Observations**:

- Fill in the following "data dictionary"

| Column     | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `high_GPA` | High school grade point average |
| `math_SAT` | Math SAT score |
| `verb_SAT` | Verbal SAT score |
| `comp_GPA` | Computer science grade point average |
| `univ_GPA` | Overall university grade point average |

- What information do we have about these students?
  - We have information about their high school GPA, SAT score for each section, computer science GPA, and overall university GPA. From the website, it says: "This study examines the SAT and GPA information of 105 students who graduated from a state university with a B.S. in computer science."
  
- What kinds of information *do we not have* about these students?
  - We don't know which colleges the surveyed students go, which year they graduated, the rigor of the university/high school they attended, what kind of classes qualified as a computer science class, and etc.
- Based on these missing variables, what possible effects could be present in the data that we would have *no way of detecting*?
  - Since the only common factor between the surveyees is that they graduated with a computer science degree with an SAT score, there might be a big gaps between their environments that affected their GPA and SAT scores. 

# Analysis with Hypothesis Testing
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We're going to use two complementary approaches to analyze the data, the first based on hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, and the second based on fitting a regression model and interpreting the regression coefficients.

To simplify the analysis, let's look at a composite SAT score:

```{r compute-composite}
## NOTE: No need to edit this
df_composite <-
  df_sat %>%
  mutate(both_SAT = math_SAT + verb_SAT)

df_composite
```

## View 1: Correlations
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### __q2__ Create a *single* plot that shows `univ_GPA` against *both* `high_GPA` and `both_SAT`. Visually compare the two trends.

*Hint*: One way to do this is to first *pivot* `df_composite`.

```{r q2-task}
df_composite %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(high_GPA, both_SAT),
    names_to = "variables",
    values_to = "score"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(score, univ_GPA)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(.~variables, scales = 'free_x')
```

**Observations**:

- What relationship do `univ_GPA` and `both_SAT` exhibit?
  - They're generally positively related, but the relationship is vague, particularly at SAT scores around 1100. 
- What relationship do `univ_GPA` and `high_GPA` exhibit?
  - They're are also generally positively related, but at the lower end of `high_GPA`, the relationship is less clear -- the range of `univ_GPA` is large and less predictable. But it seems to have a greater impact on `univ_GPA` than `both_SAT`. 

### Hypothesis Testing with a Correlation Coefficient
<!-- ------------------------- -->

We can use the idea of hypothesis testing with a correlation coefficient. The
idea is to set our null hypothesis to the case where there is no correlation,
and test to see if the data contradict that perspective. Formally, the null (H0)
and alternative (HA) hypotheses relating to a correlation coefficient between
two variables `X, Y` are:

$$\text{H0: } \text{Corr}[X, Y] = 0$$

$$\text{HA: } \text{Corr}[X, Y] \neq 0$$

The R function `cor.test` implements such a hypothesis test under the assumption that `X, Y` are both normally distributed. First, let's check to see if this assumption looks reasonable for our data.

### __q3__ Plot histograms for `both_SAT, high_GPA, univ_GPA`. Which---if any---of the variables look approximately normally distributed.

```{r q3-task}
df_composite %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(both_SAT, high_GPA, univ_GPA),
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "score"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(score), bins = 40) + 
  facet_wrap(.~variable, scale = 'free')
```

**Observations**:

- To what extent does `both_SAT` look like a normal distribution?
  - It has a slight right skew, but somewhat normal. 
- To what extent does `high_GPA` look like a normal distribution?
  - It has a high peak around 3.5 GPA but it looks normal-ish otherwise. 
- To what extent does `univ_GPA` look like a normal distribution?
  - It's the least normal appearing out of the three. 

Keep in mind your findings as you complete q4.

### __q4__ Use the function `cor.test()` to construct confidence intervals for `corr[high_GPA, univ_GPA` and `corr[both_SAT, univ_GPA]`. Answer the questions below.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO: Use the function cor.test() to test the correlations between
##       high_GPA and univ_GPA, as well as between
##       both_SAT and univ_GPA
x <- df_composite %>% pull(high_GPA)
y <- df_composite %>% pull(univ_GPA)

high_univ_GPA <- cor.test(x, y) %>% tidy()

x <- df_composite %>% pull(both_SAT)
y <- df_composite %>% pull(univ_GPA)

SAT_univ_GPA <- cor.test(x, y) %>% tidy()


cbind(as.data.frame(t(high_univ_GPA)), as.data.frame(t(SAT_univ_GPA))) %>% 
  rename(c(high_univ_GPA = 1, SAT_univ_GPA = 2))
```

**Observations**:

- Which correlations are significantly nonzero?
  - Both of the correlation values are significantly nonzero.
- Which of `high_GPA` and `both_SAT` seems to be more strongly correlated with `univ_GPA`?
  - `high_GPA` seem to be have stronger correlation to `univ_GPA`, since the confidence interval is narrower and the estimate is also about 0.1 higher than that of `both_SAT`. 
- How do the results here compare with the visual you created in q2?
  - They seem to be in line with the visual I created and the interpretations of it. 
- Based on these results, what can we say about the predictive capabilities of both `high_GPA` and `both_SAT` to predict `univ_GPA`?
  - For now, it seems like `high_GPA` is a better predictor than `both_SAT` but the sample size is too small to make a definitive conclusion. 

Finally, let's use the bootstrap to perform the same test using *different* assumptions.

### __q5__ Use the bootstrap to approximate a confidence interval for `corr[high_GPA, univ_GPA`. Compare your results---both the estimate and confidence interval---to your results from q4.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Use the bootstrap to compute a confidence interval for corr[high_GPA, univ_GPA]
df_high_univ_GPA_corr <- 
  df_composite %>% 
  bootstraps(., times = 1000) 

boot_splits <- df_high_univ_GPA_corr %>% mutate(estimates = map(splits, ~analysis(.x)))

cor_tests <- boot_splits[['estimates']] %>% 
  map(
    ., 
    ~ cor.test(.x$high_GPA, .x$univ_GPA) %>% 
      tidy() %>% 
      .[c('estimate', 'conf.low', 'conf.high')]
    )

cor_coef <- map_dbl(cor_tests, ~.x[['estimate']])

conf_interval_lo <- map_dbl(cor_tests, ~.x[['conf.low']])

conf_interval_hi <- map_dbl(cor_tests, ~.x[['conf.high']])

tibble(
  cor_coef = mean(cor_coef),
  lo = mean(conf_interval_lo),
  hi = mean(conf_interval_hi)
)

```

**Observations**:

- How does your estimate from q5 compare with your estimate from q4?
  - The estimate of about 0.7815 is very similar to about 0.77956 which was the estimate from q4.
- How does your CI from q5 compare with your CI from q4?
  - The CI is also very similar -- they are identical to two decimal places. 

*Aside*: When you use two different approximations to compute the same quantity and get similar results, that's an *encouraging sign*. Such an outcome lends a bit more credibility to the results.

## View 2: Modeling
<!-- ------------------------- -->

Correlations are useful for relating two variables at a time. To study the relationship among more variables we can instead use a fitted model. Using a model, we can also help assess whether it is *worthwhile* to measure a variable.

To begin, let's first split the data into training and validation sets.

```{r split}
## NOTE: No need to edit
set.seed(101)

df_train <-
  df_composite %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  slice_sample(n = 80)

df_validate <-
  df_composite %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  anti_join(
    .,
    df_train,
    by = "rowid"
  )
```

### Hypothesis Testing with a Model
<!-- ------------------------- -->

We can combine the ideas of hypothesis testing with a model. Using a model, we can express our hypotheses in terms of the model parameters. For instance, if we were interested in whether $X$ has an affect on $Y$, we might set up a model:

$$Y_i = \beta X_i + \epsilon_i$$

With the hypotheses:

$$\text{H0}: \beta = 0$$

$$\text{HA}: \beta \neq 0$$

In this case, we're testing for whether $X$ has a significant effect on $Y$. Let's apply this idea to relating the variables `univ_GPA` and `high_GPA`. Luckily R has built-in tools to construct a confidence interval on the $\beta$'s in a regression [1]; we'll simply use those tools rather than do it by hand.

### __q6__ Fit a linear model predicting `univ_GPA` with the predictor `both_SAT`. Assess the model to determine how effective a predictor `both_SAT` is for `univ_GPA`. Interpret the resulting confidence interval for the coefficient on `both_SAT`.

```{r q6-task}
## TODO: Fit a model of univ_GPA on the predictor both_SAT
fit_basic <- 
  lm(
    data = df_train,
    formula = univ_GPA ~ both_SAT
  )

## NOTE: The following computes confidence intervals on regression coefficients
fit_basic %>%
  tidy(
    conf.int = TRUE,
    conf.level = 0.99
  )
mse(fit_basic, df_validate)

new <- df_validate %>% select(both_SAT)

ggplot(df_train, aes(both_SAT, univ_GPA)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "train")) +
  geom_point(data = df_validate, aes(color = "validate")) +
  geom_point(data = df_validate, aes(x = both_SAT, y = predict(fit_basic, new), color = "fitted validate"), shape = 3, size = 3)
```

**Observations**:

- What is the confidence interval on the coefficient of `both_SAT`? Is this coefficient significantly different from zero?
  - The confidence interval is from about 0.0017 to 0.0034. The coefficient is significantly different from zero.
- By itself, how well does `both_SAT` predict `univ_GPA`?
  - It seems to be able to predict the general trend but the error is pretty large in predicting `univ_GPA`.

Remember from `e-model03-interp-warnings` that there are challenges with interpreting regression coefficients! Let's investigate that idea further.

### __q7__ Fit a model predicting `univ_GPA` using both `high_GPA` and `both_SAT`. Compare the prediction accuracy and hypothesis test results.

```{r q7-task}
## TODO: Fit and assess models with predictors both_SAT + high_GPA, and high_GPA alone

fit_high_GPA <- 
  lm(
    data = df_train,
    formula = univ_GPA ~ high_GPA
  )
fit_high_GPA %>% 
  tidy(
    conf.int = TRUE,
    conf.level = 0.99
  )

fit_composite <- 
  lm(
    data = df_train,
    formula = univ_GPA ~ both_SAT + high_GPA
  )

fit_composite %>% 
  tidy(
    conf.int = TRUE,
    conf.level = 0.99
  )

mse(fit_basic, df_validate)
mse(fit_high_GPA, df_validate)
mse(fit_composite, df_validate)

```

**Observations**:

- How well do these models perform, compared to the one you built in q6?
  - The model with two features performs the best, followed by model with `high_GPA` and then `both_SAT` -- the mean-squared-errors are smallest to largest respectively. However, the confidence interval is much bigger for `high_GPA` when using both features in the model ranging from about 0.30 to 0.84 while the model with just `high_GPA` had an interval of about 0.50 to 0.83. The p-value for `both_SAT` in the model for both features is significantly larger than the that from q6. 
- What is the confidence interval on the coefficient of `both_SAT` when including `high_GPA` as a predictor?? Is this coefficient significantly different from zero?
  - The confidence interval is from about -0.00067 to 0.0017, including 0 in its interval. The coefficient is 0.00053, which is a very small value close to 0. 
- How do the hypothesis test results compare with the results in q6?
  - `high_GPA` has a coefficient significantly different from 0, which rejects the null hypothesis. With both `high_GPA` and `both_SAT` as predictors, `both_SAT` seemed to have much smaller influence on `univ_GPA`. It also had a much larger p-value of about 0.25, which questions its statistical significance. It did not reject the null hypothesis unlike the results in q6. 

## Synthesize
<!-- ------------------------- -->

Before closing, let's synthesize a bit from the analyses above.

### __q8__ Using the results from all previous q's, answer the following questions.

**Observations**:

- Between `both_SAT` and `high_GPA`, which single variable would you choose to predict `univ_GPA`? Why?
  - I would choose `high_GPA` to predict `univ_GPA`. The correlation coefficient is larger with `univ_GPA` and the regression model's mean-squared-error is smaller for `high_GPA` than fitted with `both_SAT`. The coefficients when both features were included in the formula for the model were much bigger for `high_GPA` than for `both_SAT` even considering the magnitude of the typical values -- using theoretical values of GPA and SAT score, it shows that 0.57 * 3 = 1.71 using coefficient for `high_GPA` and 0.00053 * 1200 = 0.636 using coefficient for `both_SAT`. 
- Is `both_SAT` an effective predictor of `univ_GPA`? What specific pieces of evidence do you have in favor of `both_SAT` being effective? What specific pieces of evidence do you have against?
  - The correlation coefficient of about 0.68 is quite large, which suggests `both_SAT` as an effective predictor. The scatter plot of `both_SAT` and `univ_GPA` showed a weak correlation at lower SAT scores and stronger correlation at higher SAT scores. The linear model with `both_SAT` and `high_GPA` showed a relatively much smaller coefficient for `both_SAT` than that for `high_GPA`, which shows that it's a less influential predictor than `high_GPA`. It also had a large p-value for `both_SAT` in the model with both features which suggests that the results might be due to chance.
